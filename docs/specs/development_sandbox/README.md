# Development Sandbox Platform Specification

## Overview

The Development Sandbox Platform extends the existing Apex Sandbox isolation infrastructure to create a comprehensive development acceleration system. While the original sandbox focused on secure code isolation for running untrusted code, this platform transforms it into a powerful development tool that enables real-time code experimentation, advanced debugging, and distributed development workflows.

## Documentation Structure

This specification is organized into the following documents:

### Core Documentation

1. **[Overview](01_overview.md)** - Executive summary, vision, and key concepts
2. **[Architecture](02_architecture.md)** - System architecture, deployment patterns, and communication protocols
3. **[Core Components](03_core_components.md)** - Detailed specifications for each major component
4. **[Integration Patterns](04_integration_patterns.md)** - How to integrate with existing applications
5. **[Advanced Features](05_advanced_features.md)** - Time-travel debugging, live state manipulation, and more
6. **[Implementation Guide](06_implementation_guide.md)** - Step-by-step implementation roadmap

### Additional Resources (To Be Added)

7. **API Reference** - Complete API documentation
8. **Troubleshooting Guide** - Common issues and solutions
9. **Performance Tuning** - Optimization strategies
10. **Security Guidelines** - Best practices for secure usage

## Quick Start

### For Developers

If you want to understand what the Development Sandbox can do:
1. Start with the [Overview](01_overview.md) to understand the vision
2. Review [Advanced Features](05_advanced_features.md) to see capabilities
3. Check [Integration Patterns](04_integration_patterns.md) for your use case

### For Implementers

If you're implementing the Development Sandbox:
1. Read the [Architecture](02_architecture.md) specification
2. Study [Core Components](03_core_components.md) in detail
3. Follow the [Implementation Guide](06_implementation_guide.md)

### For Users

If you're using an existing Development Sandbox installation:
1. Check [Integration Patterns](04_integration_patterns.md) for your framework
2. Explore [Advanced Features](05_advanced_features.md) for powerful capabilities
3. Reference the API documentation (coming soon)

## Key Features

### Development Acceleration
- **Real-time code experimentation** without application restart
- **Hot-code reloading** with state preservation
- **A/B testing** for code changes
- **Performance profiling** with minimal overhead

### Advanced Debugging
- **Time-travel debugging** with state snapshots
- **Live state manipulation** of running processes
- **Distributed debugging** across multiple nodes
- **Interactive debugging sessions** with team collaboration

### Integration
- **Zero-configuration** mode for quick start
- **Phoenix/LiveView** specific tooling
- **Gradual adoption** path
- **Extensible plugin** architecture

## Design Principles

1. **Safety First** - Never compromise the main application
2. **Developer Experience** - Intuitive and powerful tools
3. **Minimal Overhead** - Negligible impact in production
4. **Extensibility** - Plugin architecture for customization
5. **Transparency** - Clear visibility into all operations

## Relationship to Apex Sandbox

The Development Sandbox Platform builds upon the strong isolation and security foundations of Apex Sandbox:

### From Apex Sandbox
- Module isolation and transformation
- Process-based isolation
- Virtual code tables (ETS)
- Security scanning and restrictions
- Resource monitoring and limits

### New in Development Sandbox
- Bidirectional state synchronization
- Time-travel debugging capabilities
- Live development tools
- Collaborative features
- Performance intelligence

## Implementation Status

This is a specification for a future system. The implementation will proceed in phases:

1. **Phase 1: Foundation** (Weeks 1-4)
   - Core infrastructure
   - Basic harness and state bridge
   - Initial integration patterns

2. **Phase 2: Core Features** (Weeks 5-8)
   - Experimentation engine
   - Debug orchestrator
   - Performance studio

3. **Phase 3: Advanced Integration** (Weeks 9-12)
   - Phoenix/LiveView tools
   - Distributed features
   - Production readiness

4. **Phase 4: Ecosystem** (Weeks 13-16)
   - Plugin system
   - IDE integrations
   - Community tools
