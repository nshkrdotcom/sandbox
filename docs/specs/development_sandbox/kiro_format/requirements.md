# Development Sandbox Platform Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Development Sandbox Platform extends the existing Apex Sandbox infrastructure to create a comprehensive development acceleration system. Unlike the original sandbox which focused on secure code isolation, this platform transforms the sandbox concept into a powerful development tool that enables real-time code experimentation, advanced debugging, and distributed development workflows.

### Goals

1. **Accelerate Development**: Reduce debug cycle time by 50% through real-time experimentation
2. **Enable Safe Experimentation**: Test code changes on live systems without risk
3. **Provide Advanced Debugging**: Implement time-travel debugging and state manipulation
4. **Support Team Collaboration**: Enable distributed debugging and shared development sessions
5. **Maintain Production Safety**: Ensure zero impact on production systems

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Development Harness Attachment System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to attach a development sandbox to my running application without modifying application code, so that I can start debugging immediately without deployment cycles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- WHEN a developer runs `DevSandbox.attach(MyApp)` THEN the harness SHALL attach to the running application within 5 seconds
- WHEN the harness is attached THEN it SHALL have read access to all application state WITHOUT modifying the original application
- WHEN attachment fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and SHALL NOT affect the target application
- WHEN the developer detaches the sandbox THEN all resources SHALL be cleaned up and the application SHALL continue running normally

### Requirement 2: Bidirectional State Synchronization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to synchronize state between my main application and sandbox environments, so that I can experiment with real application data while maintaining isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- WHEN state changes occur in the main application THEN the sandbox SHALL receive updates according to the configured synchronization strategy
- WHEN synchronization is configured with filters THEN only matching state SHALL be synchronized
- WHEN state transformers are applied THEN sensitive data SHALL be redacted or transformed before synchronization
- WHEN synchronization fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and SHALL NOT corrupt either application's state
- WHEN bidirectional mode is enabled THEN changes SHALL flow both ways with conflict resolution

### Requirement 3: Time-Travel Debugging Capability

**User Story:** As a developer debugging complex issues, I want to record application execution and replay it with modifications, so that I can understand cause and effect relationships in my code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- WHEN recording is started THEN the system SHALL capture all state changes, messages, and events with microsecond precision
- WHEN replaying to a specific point THEN the system SHALL restore the exact state at that moment
- WHEN modifications are applied during replay THEN the system SHALL show how execution diverges from the original
- WHEN recording large applications THEN memory usage SHALL be bounded through configurable compression and retention policies
- WHEN snapshots are created THEN they SHALL be stored efficiently with deduplication

### Requirement 4: Live State Manipulation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to modify the state of running processes without restarting them, so that I can test fixes and hypotheses immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- WHEN inspecting process state THEN the system SHALL display current state in a readable format
- WHEN modifying GenServer state THEN the system SHALL validate the new state before applying changes
- WHEN editing ETS tables THEN the system SHALL support insert, update, delete, and bulk operations
- WHEN state manipulation fails THEN the system SHALL rollback changes and restore original state
- WHEN safety mode is strict THEN dangerous operations SHALL be prevented with clear warnings

### Requirement 5: Code Experimentation Engine

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test code changes in isolation with production context, so that I can validate improvements before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- WHEN creating an experiment THEN the system SHALL snapshot relevant modules and state
- WHEN adding variants THEN each variant SHALL run in complete isolation from others
- WHEN running experiments THEN the system SHALL collect performance metrics and results
- WHEN comparing variants THEN the system SHALL provide statistical analysis and recommendations
- WHEN using A/B testing mode THEN traffic SHALL be split according to configured percentages

### Requirement 6: Distributed Debug Orchestration

**User Story:** As a developer working with distributed systems, I want to debug across multiple nodes simultaneously, so that I can trace issues through the entire system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- WHEN starting a debug session THEN the system SHALL connect to all specified nodes
- WHEN setting breakpoints THEN they SHALL be synchronized across all nodes
- WHEN stepping through code THEN all nodes SHALL advance in coordination
- WHEN collecting traces THEN the system SHALL merge and correlate events from all nodes
- WHEN a node disconnects THEN the session SHALL continue with degraded functionality

### Requirement 7: Performance Profiling Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to profile my application with minimal overhead, so that I can identify performance bottlenecks in production-like conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- WHEN profiling is enabled THEN overhead SHALL be less than 5% for CPU profiling
- WHEN memory profiling is active THEN the system SHALL track allocations with source attribution
- WHEN analyzing results THEN the system SHALL identify hotspots and provide optimization suggestions
- WHEN comparing profiles THEN the system SHALL highlight regressions and improvements
- WHEN profiling distributed systems THEN data SHALL be aggregated across nodes

### Requirement 8: Security and Access Control

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to control access to development sandbox features, so that sensitive production data remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- WHEN security policies are configured THEN they SHALL be enforced across all operations
- WHEN code is submitted for execution THEN it SHALL be scanned for dangerous patterns
- WHEN accessing sensitive data THEN audit logs SHALL record all operations
- WHEN operating in production mode THEN write operations SHALL require explicit authorization
- WHEN security violations occur THEN alerts SHALL be sent to configured channels

### Requirement 9: Phoenix/LiveView Integration

**User Story:** As a Phoenix developer, I want specialized tools for debugging LiveView applications, so that I can troubleshoot real-time features effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- WHEN attaching to a Phoenix application THEN the system SHALL automatically discover endpoints and live views
- WHEN debugging LiveView THEN the system SHALL show socket state and event handling
- WHEN modifying assigns THEN changes SHALL be reflected in the UI immediately
- WHEN profiling LiveView THEN the system SHALL track render times and event processing
- WHEN using development routes THEN they SHALL only be available in development environment

### Requirement 10: Collaborative Development Features

**User Story:** As a development team, we want to share debugging sessions and collaborate in real-time, so that we can solve complex problems together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- WHEN creating a shared session THEN multiple developers SHALL be able to join
- WHEN participants join THEN they SHALL see synchronized state and debugging context
- WHEN setting breakpoints THEN all participants SHALL see them in real-time
- WHEN adding comments or annotations THEN they SHALL be visible to all participants
- WHEN the session ends THEN a summary SHALL be available for future reference
