# Apex Platform Specification

## Overview

The Apex Platform is a unified system that combines secure code isolation with advanced development tools, providing a comprehensive solution for both production sandbox needs and development acceleration. This specification defines the architecture, components, and implementation details for version 2.0 of the platform.

## Background

The Apex Platform represents the convergence of two complementary approaches:
- **Apex Sandbox**: A security-focused code isolation system for running untrusted code
- **Development Sandbox Platform**: A developer-productivity system with debugging and experimentation tools

By unifying these approaches, the platform provides a single solution that can be configured for different use cases through its innovative mode-based architecture.

3. **Hybrid Mode** - Configurable balance of security and features

### Core Capabilities

- **Module Management** - Loading, transformation, and versioning
- **State Management** - Synchronization, preservation, and manipulation
- **Process Orchestration** - Isolation, monitoring, and communication
- **Resource Control** - Limits, monitoring, and enforcement

### Security Features

- Multi-factor authentication
- Role-based access control
- AST-based code analysis
- Runtime security monitoring
- Comprehensive audit logging

### Development Tools

- Time-travel debugging with replay
- Live state inspection and manipulation
- Code experimentation with A/B testing
- Performance profiling (CPU, memory, I/O)
- Collaborative debugging sessions

## Implementation Status

This specification is for version 2.0 of the Apex Platform. The implementation follows a phased approach:

- **Phase 1**: Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-5)
- **Phase 2**: Security and Resources (Weeks 6-8)
- **Phase 3**: Development Tools and Integration (Weeks 9-12)
- **Phase 4**: Testing and Production Readiness (Weeks 13-14)

## Design Principles

1. **Safety First** - No operation should compromise the host system
2. **Zero Overhead When Disabled** - Features have no impact when not in use
3. **Developer Experience** - Intuitive interfaces and seamless integration
4. **Composability** - Features can be mixed and matched
5. **Observability** - Comprehensive monitoring and debugging
