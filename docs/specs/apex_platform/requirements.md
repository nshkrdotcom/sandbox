# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Apex Platform unifies secure code isolation with advanced development tools, providing a comprehensive solution for both production sandbox needs and development acceleration. This document outlines the functional requirements for version 2.0 of the platform, which introduces a mode-based architecture supporting isolation, development, and hybrid operational modes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Mode-Based Architecture

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to configure different operational modes for sandboxes, so that I can optimize for security in production and productivity in development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a sandbox with mode `:isolation` THEN the system SHALL enforce module transformation, resource limits, and security scanning
2. WHEN creating a sandbox with mode `:development` THEN the system SHALL enable debugging tools, state manipulation, and performance profiling
3. WHEN creating a sandbox with mode `:hybrid` THEN the system SHALL allow configurable features based on permissions
4. WHEN switching between modes THEN the system SHALL validate the transition and apply mode-specific configurations without data loss
5. WHEN a mode is not specified THEN the system SHALL use the configured default mode

### Requirement 2: Unified Module Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent module loading and management across all modes, so that code behaves predictably regardless of the operational mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading a module in isolation mode THEN the system SHALL apply namespace transformation to prevent conflicts
2. WHEN loading a module in development mode THEN the system SHALL skip transformation for debugging transparency
3. WHEN hot-swapping a module THEN the system SHALL preserve state and update all dependent modules
4. WHEN a module version conflict occurs THEN the system SHALL handle it according to the mode's conflict resolution policy
5. WHEN tracking module dependencies THEN the system SHALL detect circular dependencies and prevent loading

### Requirement 3: State Management and Synchronization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to synchronize and manipulate state between my application and sandboxes, so that I can debug with real data and test state changes safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a state bridge THEN the system SHALL support push, pull, and bidirectional synchronization modes
2. WHEN synchronizing state THEN the system SHALL apply configured filters and transformers
3. WHEN manipulating process state in development mode THEN the system SHALL create automatic backups before changes
4. WHEN state synchronization fails THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and report detailed error information
5. WHEN capturing state snapshots THEN the system SHALL include all relevant process, ETS, and memory information

### Requirement 4: Security and Authentication

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want comprehensive security controls with mode-aware enforcement, so that production systems remain secure while development environments remain flexible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authenticating users THEN the system SHALL support API keys, JWT tokens, and OAuth2
2. WHEN scanning code in isolation mode THEN the system SHALL block dangerous operations and report violations
3. WHEN enforcing permissions in hybrid mode THEN the system SHALL check role-based access controls
4. WHEN security violations occur THEN the system SHALL log events to the audit trail with full context
5. WHEN operating in development mode THEN the system SHALL warn about dangerous operations without blocking

### Requirement 5: Resource Management

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want fine-grained resource controls with mode-specific defaults, so that I can prevent resource exhaustion while allowing flexibility in development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN allocating resources for isolation mode THEN the system SHALL enforce strict limits on memory, CPU, and processes
2. WHEN allocating resources for development mode THEN the system SHALL allow unlimited resources with monitoring
3. WHEN resource limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL take configured actions (terminate, throttle, or warn)
4. WHEN monitoring resource usage THEN the system SHALL collect metrics for memory, CPU, processes, and ETS tables
5. WHEN deallocating resources THEN the system SHALL ensure complete cleanup without affecting other sandboxes

### Requirement 6: Time-Travel Debugging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to record and replay application execution with the ability to modify state, so that I can debug complex issues and test hypotheses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recording execution THEN the system SHALL capture all function calls, returns, and state changes
2. WHEN replaying execution THEN the system SHALL allow stepping forward, backward, and to specific events
3. WHEN modifying state during replay THEN the system SHALL show execution divergence from the original
4. WHEN storage limits are reached THEN the system SHALL rotate recordings based on configured retention
5. WHEN recording in production THEN the system SHALL minimize overhead to less than 5%

### Requirement 7: Live State Manipulation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to inspect and modify running application state without restarts, so that I can fix issues and test changes immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN inspecting process state THEN the system SHALL display current state with configurable depth and sanitization
2. WHEN modifying process state THEN the system SHALL validate changes and create automatic backups
3. WHEN injecting messages THEN the system SHALL allow positioning and timing control
4. WHEN manipulating ETS tables THEN the system SHALL support CRUD operations with transaction semantics
5. WHEN rollback is requested THEN the system SHALL restore previous state from backups

### Requirement 8: Performance Profiling

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want comprehensive profiling tools with minimal overhead, so that I can identify and fix performance issues in development and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN profiling CPU usage THEN the system SHALL support both sampling and tracing modes
2. WHEN profiling memory THEN the system SHALL track allocations, garbage collection, and leak candidates
3. WHEN analyzing profile data THEN the system SHALL generate flamegraphs and recommendations
4. WHEN profiling in production THEN the overhead SHALL be less than 1%
5. WHEN comparing profiles THEN the system SHALL identify regressions and improvements

### Requirement 9: Framework Integration

**User Story:** As an application developer, I want seamless integration with Phoenix, Ecto, and OTP, so that I can use Apex features without modifying my application architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with Phoenix THEN the system SHALL provide plugs, LiveView hooks, and development routes
2. WHEN integrating with Ecto THEN the system SHALL enable query profiling and migration sandboxing
3. WHEN integrating with GenServers THEN the system SHALL add inspection and manipulation capabilities
4. WHEN using integrations THEN the system SHALL respect the configured operational mode
5. WHEN integrations are not available THEN the system SHALL work with basic functionality

### Requirement 10: Production Operations

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want production-ready deployment options with monitoring and high availability, so that I can run Apex reliably at scale.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL support Docker, Kubernetes, and native deployments
2. WHEN monitoring the platform THEN the system SHALL expose Prometheus metrics and health endpoints
3. WHEN running in cluster mode THEN the system SHALL coordinate state across nodes
4. WHEN failures occur THEN the system SHALL isolate failures and maintain platform availability
5. WHEN scaling horizontally THEN the system SHALL support 100+ concurrent sandboxes per node
