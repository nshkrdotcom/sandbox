# Apex Platform - Overview

## Executive Summary

The Apex Platform is a unified system that combines secure code isolation with advanced development tools, providing a comprehensive solution for both production sandbox needs and development acceleration. By merging the security-focused Apex Sandbox with developer-productivity features, it creates a versatile platform configurable for any use case through its innovative mode-based architecture.

## Vision Statement

Create the definitive platform for the Elixir ecosystem that enables:
- **Secure execution** of untrusted code in production environments
- **Rapid development** through real-time debugging and experimentation
- **Flexible deployment** with mode-based configuration
- **Progressive enhancement** from basic isolation to full development features

## Core Concept: Three Operational Modes

### 1. Isolation Mode
**Purpose**: Secure execution of untrusted or third-party code  
**Use Cases**: Multi-tenant platforms, plugin systems, CI/CD sandboxes, educational environments  
**Key Features**:
- Module namespace transformation
- Process-based isolation
- Resource limits and monitoring
- Security scanning and enforcement
- Audit logging

### 2. Development Mode
**Purpose**: Accelerate development through advanced debugging and experimentation  
**Use Cases**: Local development, debugging production issues, performance optimization  
**Key Features**:
- Zero-friction application attachment
- Time-travel debugging
- Live state manipulation
- Code experimentation
- Performance profiling

### 3. Hybrid Mode
**Purpose**: Combine security with development features based on permissions  
**Use Cases**: Staging environments, team development, secure debugging  
**Key Features**:
- Configurable security policies
- Permission-based feature access
- Selective isolation
- Audited development operations

## Key Innovations

### 1. Unified Architecture
Single codebase serving multiple use cases through configuration rather than separate projects.

### 2. Mode-Based Configuration
```elixir
# Production: Maximum security
Apex.create("plugin", PluginModule, mode: :isolation)

# Development: Maximum productivity  
Apex.attach(MyApp, mode: :development)

# Staging: Balanced approach
Apex.create("staging", MyApp, mode: :hybrid)
```

### 3. Progressive Enhancement
Start with basic isolation and progressively enable features as needed without code changes.

### 4. Backward Compatibility
Existing Apex Sandbox code continues to work unchanged while gaining access to new features.

## Platform Components

### Core Engine
- **Module Management**: Loading, transformation, versioning
- **State Management**: Synchronization, preservation, manipulation
- **Process Orchestration**: Isolation, monitoring, communication
- **Resource Control**: Limits, monitoring, enforcement

### Security Layer
- **Code Analysis**: AST-based scanning for dangerous patterns
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions and policies
- **Audit System**: Comprehensive logging and compliance
- **Runtime Protection**: Syscall monitoring and anomaly detection

### Development Layer
- **Debugging Tools**: Breakpoints, stepping, inspection
- **Time-Travel**: Record and replay with modifications
- **Experimentation**: A/B testing and variant comparison
- **Collaboration**: Shared sessions and team features

### Infrastructure
- **Storage**: ETS tables, persistent storage, caching
- **Distribution**: Multi-node support and coordination
- **Monitoring**: Telemetry, metrics, and observability
- **Integration**: Phoenix, LiveView, and framework support

## Use Cases

### Production Scenarios

#### Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform
```elixir
defmodule MyApp.TenantRunner do
  def run_tenant_code(tenant_id, code) do
    {:ok, sandbox} = Apex.create(
      "tenant_#{tenant_id}",
      code,
      mode: :isolation,
      resource_limits: %{memory: "100MB", cpu: 50}
    )
    
    Apex.execute(sandbox, :main, [])
  end
end
```

#### Plugin System
```elixir
defmodule MyApp.PluginManager do
  def load_plugin(plugin_path) do
    Apex.create(
      Path.basename(plugin_path),
      plugin_path,
      mode: :isolation,
      security_profile: :high,
      allowed_modules: [:logger, :jason]
    )
  end
end
```

### Development Scenarios

#### Production Debugging
```elixir
# Attach to running production app with read-only access
{:ok, session} = Apex.attach(
  MyApp,
  mode: :development,
  features: [:inspection, :profiling],
  read_only: true
)

# Record execution for offline analysis
Apex.TimeTravel.start_recording(session)
```

#### Performance Optimization
```elixir
# Create experiment to test optimization
{:ok, experiment} = Apex.Experimentation.create("query_optimization")

# Add variants
Apex.Experimentation.add_variant(experiment, :current, current_implementation)
Apex.Experimentation.add_variant(experiment, :optimized, new_implementation)

# Run comparison
results = Apex.Experimentation.compare(experiment, production_dataset)
```

## Design Principles

### 1. Safety First
No operation should compromise the host system or application. All risky operations require explicit permission.

### 2. Zero Overhead When Disabled
Development features have zero impact when not in use. Production systems pay no penalty.

### 3. Developer Experience
Rich, intuitive interfaces that integrate seamlessly with existing workflows and tools.

### 4. Composability
Features can be mixed and matched based on specific needs without conflicts.

### 5. Observability
All operations are transparent with comprehensive monitoring and debugging capabilities.

## Success Metrics

### Performance
- **Isolation Mode**: <10% overhead for sandboxed execution
- **Development Mode**: <1% overhead when attached
- **Hot Reload**: <1 second for code updates
