## Migration Strategy

### For Existing Apex Sandbox Users

```elixir
# Old API (still supported)
{:ok, sandbox} = Sandbox.Manager.create_sandbox("test", MyApp.Supervisor)

# New unified API (recommended)
{:ok, sandbox} = Apex.create("test", MyApp, mode: :isolation)
```

### Gradual Adoption Path

1. **Update Dependencies**
   ```elixir
   {:apex_platform, "~> 2.0"}
   ```

2. **Maintain Compatibility**
   - Existing API continues to work
   - Maps to isolation mode by default
   - Deprecation warnings guide migration

3. **Adopt New Features**
   - Start with isolation mode (current behavior)
   - Enable development mode for debugging
   - Use hybrid mode for gradual adoption

## Success Metrics
