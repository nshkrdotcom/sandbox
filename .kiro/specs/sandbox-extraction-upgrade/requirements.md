# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for extracting and upgrading the sandbox functionality from the SuperLearner monolithic application into a standalone, production-ready Sandbox package. The goal is to create a comprehensive OTP sandbox system that provides isolated application management, hot-reload capabilities, and advanced testing infrastructure while maintaining all existing functionality and adding significant architectural improvements.

The extracted Sandbox package will serve as a testing platform for OTP applications, providing complete isolation, hot-reload capabilities, version management, and comprehensive testing utilities. This is not just an extraction but a full architectural upgrade to implement the "true sandbox architecture" as documented in the SuperLearner technical specifications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Sandbox Manager Extraction and Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer using the Sandbox package, I want a complete sandbox management system that can create, manage, and destroy isolated OTP applications, so that I can safely test and develop OTP code without affecting my main application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a sandbox THEN the SandboxManager SHALL create a completely isolated OTP application with its own supervision tree
2. WHEN managing multiple sandboxes THEN each sandbox SHALL run independently without interference from other sandboxes
3. WHEN a sandbox crashes THEN it SHALL not affect the host system or other sandboxes
4. WHEN destroying a sandbox THEN all resources SHALL be properly cleaned up including processes, ETS tables, and temporary files
5. WHEN listing sandboxes THEN the manager SHALL provide comprehensive information about each sandbox's status, resource usage, and configuration

### Requirement 2: Advanced Hot-Reload System with True Isolation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want true hot-reload capabilities with complete fault isolation, so that I can update running code in real-time without risking system stability or affecting other sandboxes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hot-reloading code THEN the IsolatedCompiler SHALL compile code in a separate process with timeout and resource limits
2. WHEN compilation fails THEN the failure SHALL not affect the host system or other sandboxes
3. WHEN hot-swapping modules THEN the ModuleVersionManager SHALL preserve GenServer state and handle dependency updates
4. WHEN rollback is needed THEN the system SHALL automatically restore the previous working version
5. WHEN managing module versions THEN the system SHALL track up to 10 versions per module with dependency information

### Requirement 3: Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure Integration

**User Story:** As a test engineer, I want the Sandbox package to integrate seamlessly with Supertester and provide comprehensive testing utilities, so that I can write reliable, fast tests that follow OTP best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing tests THEN the Sandbox SHALL integrate with Supertester helpers for OTP-compliant testing patterns
2. WHEN running tests THEN all tests SHALL use `async: true` with proper process isolation
3. WHEN testing sandbox functionality THEN zero `Process.sleep/1` calls SHALL be used, replaced with proper OTP synchronization
4. WHEN testing distributed scenarios THEN the Sandbox SHALL support multi-node testing with ClusterTest integration
5. WHEN running performance tests THEN the system SHALL complete all tests in under 30 seconds with no process leaks

### Requirement 4: Resource Management and Security Controls

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive resource management and security controls for sandboxes, so that I can safely run untrusted code with proper limits and monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating sandboxes THEN configurable resource limits SHALL be enforced including memory, CPU, and process count
2. WHEN monitoring resources THEN real-time usage tracking SHALL be available with alerting on limit violations
3. WHEN executing code THEN dangerous operations SHALL be restricted or sandboxed appropriately
4. WHEN security violations occur THEN automatic containment and alerting SHALL be triggered
5. WHEN auditing is required THEN comprehensive logging SHALL track all sandbox operations and resource usage

### Requirement 5: File System Watching and Auto-Reload

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic code reloading when files change, so that I can have a smooth development experience with immediate feedback on code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files change in a sandbox directory THEN the FileWatcher SHALL detect changes within 300ms
2. WHEN triggering compilation THEN debounced compilation SHALL prevent excessive rebuilds
3. WHEN compilation succeeds THEN hot-reload SHALL complete in under 1 second
4. WHEN compilation fails THEN clear error messages SHALL be provided without affecting the running sandbox
5. WHEN watching multiple sandboxes THEN file watching SHALL scale efficiently with minimal CPU overhead

### Requirement 6: State Preservation and Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want process state to be preserved during hot-reloads, so that I can update code without losing application state or requiring restarts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hot-reloading GenServers THEN state SHALL be automatically preserved across module updates
2. WHEN state schema changes THEN custom migration functions SHALL be supported for complex state transformations
3. WHEN migration fails THEN automatic rollback SHALL restore the previous working state
4. WHEN updating supervisors THEN child specifications SHALL be updated without unnecessary process restarts
5. WHEN preserving state THEN the system SHALL handle both simple and complex state structures including nested maps and structs

### Requirement 7: Distributed Sandbox Support

**User Story:** As a distributed systems developer, I want sandboxes to work across multiple nodes, so that I can test distributed OTP applications in realistic environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in distributed mode THEN sandboxes SHALL support multi-node operation with proper clustering
2. WHEN nodes join or leave THEN sandbox state SHALL be maintained and synchronized appropriately
3. WHEN testing distributed scenarios THEN ClusterTest integration SHALL provide automated node management
4. WHEN network partitions occur THEN sandboxes SHALL handle partitions gracefully with proper recovery
5. WHEN scaling horizontally THEN sandbox management SHALL distribute load across available nodes

### Requirement 8: Advanced Compilation and Module Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want advanced compilation features with dependency tracking and incremental compilation, so that I can work efficiently with complex codebases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compiling code THEN dependency analysis SHALL determine optimal reload order for related modules
2. WHEN only function bodies change THEN incremental compilation SHALL be used to speed up reloads
3. WHEN dependencies change THEN cascading reloads SHALL update all affected modules in the correct order
4. WHEN compilation artifacts are created THEN temporary files SHALL be properly managed and cleaned up
5. WHEN validating BEAM files THEN comprehensive integrity checks SHALL ensure safe module loading

### Requirement 9: Integration with External Systems

**User Story:** As a platform integrator, I want the Sandbox package to integrate with external monitoring, logging, and development tools, so that it fits seamlessly into existing development workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with IDEs THEN the Sandbox SHALL provide APIs for editor integration and debugging
2. WHEN monitoring systems connect THEN telemetry events SHALL be emitted for all major operations
3. WHEN logging is required THEN structured logging SHALL provide comprehensive audit trails
4. WHEN using CI/CD systems THEN the Sandbox SHALL support automated testing and deployment workflows
5. WHEN integrating with external tools THEN well-documented APIs SHALL enable third-party extensions

### Requirement 10: Production-Ready Architecture and Performance

**User Story:** As a production system operator, I want the Sandbox package to be production-ready with excellent performance, monitoring, and operational characteristics, so that I can deploy it in production environments safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in production THEN the system SHALL handle 100+ concurrent sandboxes with minimal overhead
2. WHEN memory usage is monitored THEN each sandbox SHALL use less than 50MB base overhead
3. WHEN performance is measured THEN hot-reload operations SHALL complete in under 1 second
4. WHEN errors occur THEN comprehensive error handling SHALL provide clear diagnostics and recovery options
5. WHEN operating at scale THEN the system SHALL provide metrics, health checks, and operational monitoring capabilities
