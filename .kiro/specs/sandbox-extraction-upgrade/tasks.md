# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan provides a series of discrete, manageable coding tasks for extracting and upgrading the sandbox functionality from SuperLearner into a standalone Sandbox package. Each task builds incrementally on previous tasks and focuses on writing, modifying, or testing code that can be executed by a coding agent.

The plan follows test-driven development principles and ensures comprehensive integration with Supertester for OTP-compliant testing patterns.
